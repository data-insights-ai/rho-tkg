# rho-tkg backlog

**STATUS: ALL DONE — no open items.**

Every rho-tkg-owned design item has shipped. This is the single roadmap/todo file
for the repo; when something is open it goes here, and right now nothing is.
Full per-feature detail, measured numbers, and design narrative live in
`CHANGELOG.md` (the source of truth); prior long-form design docs are recoverable
from git history (`git show <rev>:tasks/backlog.md`, and `git log --all -- docs/adr/`).

## Shipped (was the backlog)

- **BACKLOG 1 — Retention purge (ex-ADR-0008 R2–R5).** Single-store age purge
  (R2) + `UniqueForever` owner reaping, `ChangeRangePurge` record + replica
  re-execution (R3), sharded + tiered cross-shard sweep (R4) incl. the tiered
  O(1) cold-shard-drop drain-protocol optimization, and `ByValidTo` (R5).
- **BACKLOG 2 — Cross-machine incoming half-edge "Model A" (ADR-0010 §3.3).**
  Store write, replica apply, graph door + byte-exact convergence, cascade, and
  the tx-rollback stub restore. All increments shipped and byte-exact verified.
- **BACKLOG 3 — Columnar / streaming whole-node fetch (sigma X5-wholenode).**
  The one-iterator bulk substrate (`forEachNodeBulk`, `PrefetchValues=false`
  load-bearing), parallel decode across cores (`collectNodesBulkParallel` with
  batched staging), the same substrate under `AllNodes` and the DocValues
  cold-build (`bulkNodePropGetter`), and the streaming door
  `g.Nodes().ForEachByLabel` + `IterByLabel` (O(1) peak memory). The as-of
  columnar sibling (`DocValuesSnapshotAsOf`) shipped + corrected with the
  (label, txAt) cache.
- **BACKLOG 4 — Review-driven adaptations.** 4b per-label DocValues epoch,
  4c configurable `HistoryAnchorInterval` (persisted compat marker), 4d ingest
  `IntentRecord` cleanup, 4e `PeekTx`. (4a per-version temporal-envelope prune
  was owner-decided **DO NOT BUILD** — net-negative for the confirmed workload.)
- **BACKLOG 5 — Rel-side ordering-soundness primitives (sigma).**
  `g.Stats().RelRangeCardinality` (5A) and `g.Stats().RelPropertyTypeClassCounts`
  (5B) — rule-2 mirrors of the node doors.

## Not tracked here (cross-team)

Sigma-coordinated RPCs are sigma's to build; rho-tkg already exposes the local
primitives they call, so they are intentionally **not** rho-tkg backlog items:
the START→END foreign-stub-delete fan-out (BACKLOG 2 Inc 4c) and the
consumer-gated constraint dry-run (HP2.5). When sigma pins a shape that needs a
new rho-tkg primitive, it re-enters here as a fresh, concrete item.
