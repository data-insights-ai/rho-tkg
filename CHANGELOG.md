# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).

## [3.0.13] - 2026-02-28

### Fixed

- **Graph.Close() data race** — `closeFn` was read/written without synchronization; two concurrent `Close()` calls would race on the nil check. Replaced with `sync.Once` (`closeOnce`) for race-free idempotency.
- **Query methods swallow corruption errors** — `NodesByLabel`, `RelationshipsByType`, `OutgoingRelationships`, `IncomingRelationships` used bare `continue` on all errors, silently eating I/O and corruption errors. Now only `ErrNodeNotFound` / `ErrRelNotFound` (index orphans) are skipped; all other errors propagate to the caller.
- **Dead variable `relDeleteCount`** — written but never read in `DeleteNodeCascade`. Removed.

### Changed

- **Test-only code relocated** — 12 functions and 6 constants (`histNodeKey`, `histRelKey`, `tempNodeKey`, `tempRelKey`, `labelIndexPrefix`, `relTypeIndexPrefix`, `outPrefix`, `outTypedPrefix`, `inPrefix`, `inTypedPrefix`, `parseNodeIDFromLabelIdx`, `parseRelIDFromTypeIdx`) moved from `keys.go` to `keys_helpers_test.go`. Reduces production binary size.
- **`toIntSlice` test coverage** — added `TestWireRoundTripIntSlice` exercising `[]int` property wire round-trip. No longer at 0% coverage.

## [3.0.12] - 2026-02-28

### Fixed

- **Atomic counter persistence** — counter keys (`meta/node_count`, `meta/rel_count`) are now written in the same `WriteBatch` as entity data. Previously, `persistCounters()` was a separate transaction, creating a TOCTOU window where counters could drift from actual entity count on crash recovery.
- **O(N) → O(1) evictClean** — LRU `evictClean()` was O(N²) due to restarting the inner scan from `Back()` after each eviction. Now a single-pass backward scan with `prev` pointer — O(N) worst case.
- **Cascade delete error propagation** — `DeleteNodeCascade` now checks `errors.Is(err, ErrRelNotFound)` and propagates non-sentinel errors (data corruption). Previously all `deleteRelLocked` errors were silently swallowed.
- **Close() InMemory flush** — `Close()` now calls `bs.flush()` unconditionally, ensuring pending ops are persisted even when `flushLoop` was never spawned (InMemory mode or zero FlushInterval).

### Changed

- **O(1) existence checks** — added `relIDs` map (mirrors `nodeIDs`) for O(1) relationship existence lookups. `GetRelationship()` and `PutRelationship()` now short-circuit via `relIDs` instead of scanning `typeIdx`. Removed dead `relExistsInIndex()` O(N) scan.
- **`GetNode()` / `GetRelationship()` bloom filter** — on cache miss, both methods check `nodeIDs`/`relIDs` (O(1)) before opening a Badger `db.View()` transaction, avoiding disk I/O for non-existent entities.
- **`persistCounters()` removed** — counter persistence is now inlined into `flush()` as part of the atomic WriteBatch.

## [3.0.11] - 2026-02-28

### Fixed

- **Version-aware dirty tracking** — LRU `CollectDirty()` is now read-only; `MarkFlushed()` only clears entries matching the collected `dirtyVer`. Prevents data loss when new writes land between `CollectDirty()` and `MarkFlushed()`.
- **Map-based pending write buffer** — replaced `[]writeOp` with `map[string]writeOp` for last-write-wins deduplication. `requeueOps()` preserves newer writes over failed ops. Prevents chronological write inversion on flush retry.
- **Cascade index scrub** — `DeleteNodeCascade` now scrubs `labelIdx` by scanning all label sets when entity data is unreadable, preventing ghost index entries.

## [3.0.10] - 2026-02-28

### Added

- **LRU entity caches** (`pkg/graph/lru.go`) — generic `entityLRU[V]` with dirty tracking, tombstone support, and soft capacity (dirty entries never evicted until flushed). BadgerStore maintains separate caches for nodes and relationships. Configurable via `BadgerStoreConfig.CacheCapacity` (default 10,000 per cache).
- **Entity lock manager** (`pkg/graph/entity_locks.go`) — 256-shard `sync.Mutex` array for write-skew prevention. `LockTwo(a, b)` acquires shards in ascending order (deadlock-free). Self-loops and same-shard IDs handled correctly with single lock acquisition.
- **Async batch persistence** — write operations update in-memory state immediately and queue `writeOp` structs. Background flush loop drains the buffer via Badger `WriteBatch` (blind writes = zero OCC conflicts) every `FlushInterval` (default 100ms). Failed ops are re-queued for retry.
- **Background value log GC** — periodic `RunValueLogGC()` loop (default 5min interval, configurable via `GCInterval`). Skipped entirely in in-memory mode.
- **In-memory indexes** — `nodeIDs`, `labelIdx`, `typeIdx`, `outIdx`, `inIdx` maps rebuilt from Badger on startup via `loadIndexes()`. In-memory state is the source of truth while running. Badger is the durable backing store.
- **`BadgerStoreConfig`** new fields: `CacheCapacity`, `FlushInterval`, `GCInterval`, `GCDiscardRatio`.
- **`BadgerStore.Flush()`** — explicit flush for tests that need to verify durable persistence.
- **Write-skew regression test** (`TestGraphAddRelDeleteNodeConcurrency`) — 100 iterations of concurrent `AddRelationship` + `DeleteNode` on overlapping entities, verifying no dangling edges.

### Changed

- **BadgerStore architecture** — replaced synchronous per-operation Badger transactions with cache-first reads + async batch writes. Read path: LRU cache hit → return; cache miss → `db.View()` → populate cache; tombstone → `ErrNotFound`. Write path: update cache (dirty) + update indexes + queue writeOps.
- **Counter implementation** — replaced `incrCounter()` inside Badger transactions with `atomic.Int64` fields on the BadgerStore struct. Counters are persisted by the flush loop piggyback. Eliminates all OCC contention on concurrent writes.
- **`Graph.AddRelationship`** — now acquires entity locks on both endpoints via `LockTwo(startID, endID)` before ID generation. Prevents write-skew where concurrent `AddRelationship(→X)` + `DeleteNodeCascade(X)` both commit, producing a dangling edge.
- **`Graph.DeleteNode`** — now acquires entity lock on the target via `LockEntity(id)` before cascade.
- **`DeleteNodeCascade` (BadgerStore)** — atomic in-memory under `idxMu` write lock with async Badger writes, replacing single `db.Update()` transaction.
- **`Close()`** — idempotent via `sync.Once`. Stops background goroutines, performs final flush, persists counters, closes Badger.

### Removed

- `incrCounter()` — replaced by atomic counters.
- `initCounters()` — replaced by `loadIndexes()` + counter loading from meta keys.

## [3.0.9] - 2026-02-27

### Fixed

- **Close() file handle leak** — `Graph.Close()` now always calls `closeFn()` even if registry saves fail. Previously, a failed `SaveLabelRegistry` or `SaveRelTypeRegistry` would exit early, leaving the Badger file handle open. `closeFn()` now runs unconditionally; the first error is collected and returned.
- **Type erasure in wire format** — msgpack serialization destroyed Go type fidelity (`[]string` → `[]any`, `int64` → `int8`). Added a `Type byte` tag to `propertyWire` that records the concrete Go type during serialization and reconstructs it during deserialization. 24 type tags cover all allowlisted property types. Backward compatible: old data without the tag (decoded as `Type: 0`) falls through to integer normalization.
- **Silent data loss on query errors** — Store query methods (`NodesByLabel`, `RelationshipsByType`, `OutgoingRelationships`, `IncomingRelationships`, `NodeCount`, `RelationshipCount`) now return `error`. `BadgerStore` propagates I/O and corruption errors instead of swallowing them. `MemoryStore` always returns `nil`.
- **TOCTOU cascade-delete** — `Graph.DeleteNode` was executing N+2 separate lock acquisitions/transactions, creating a window where concurrent `AddRelationship` could produce dangling edges. Both `MemoryStore.DeleteNodeCascade` and `BadgerStore.DeleteNodeCascade` now execute the entire cascade atomically — single write lock / single `db.Update()` transaction.
- **O(N) counts** — `BadgerStore.NodeCount()` and `RelationshipCount()` previously did full prefix scans. Now maintained as atomic metadata counters (`meta/node_count`, `meta/rel_count`) incremented/decremented within each mutating transaction — O(1) reads. Counter initialization scans on first open for backward compatibility with existing databases.

### Changed

- **`Store` interface** — all 6 query methods now return `error`. Added `DeleteNodeCascade(id snowflake.ID) error`. `Graph.DeleteNode` delegates to `DeleteNodeCascade`.
- **`propertyWire`** struct gained `Type byte` field (msgpack tag `"t"`).

## [3.0.8] - 2026-02-27

### Added

- **Badger persistence** (`pkg/graph/badgerstore.go`) — `BadgerStore` implementing the `Store` interface using [Badger v4](https://github.com/dgraph-io/badger) as the storage backend. Supports in-memory mode for testing and on-disk persistence. Includes type index, label index, and adjacency index maintenance.
- **Msgpack wire formats** (`pkg/graph/wire.go`) — `nodeWire`, `relWire`, `propertyWire` structs with conversion functions for serialization boundary. Handles temporal metadata, integrity hashes, and type normalization (msgpack compact integer encoding).
- **Binary key encoding** (`pkg/graph/keys.go`) — fixed-width binary keys with single-byte prefix tags for correct sort order. All snowflake IDs stored as big-endian uint64; tokens as big-endian uint16. 10 key types covering entities, indexes, adjacency, history, temporal, and metadata.
- **Registry persistence** — `ExportNames()` / `ImportNames(names)` on both `labelRegistry` and `relTypeRegistry`. `BadgerStore` persists registries as msgpack `[]string` under `meta/label_tokens` and `meta/reltype_tokens`.
- **`Graph.Close()`** — saves registries to Badger (if applicable), then closes the database. Idempotent. No-op for `MemoryStore`.
- **`Config.BadgerDir`** / **`Config.BadgerInMemory`** — creates a `BadgerStore` automatically when `Config.Store` is nil. Loads persisted registries on startup; fail-fast on corrupt data.
- **`ErrRegistryNotEmpty`** sentinel error — returned when `ImportNames` is called on a non-empty registry.

### Dependencies

- Added `github.com/vmihailenco/msgpack/v5` v5.4.1
- Added `github.com/dgraph-io/badger/v4` v4.9.1

## [3.0.7] - 2026-02-27

### Changed

- **Snowflake dependency migrated** from `gitlab2024.bds421-cloud.com/bds421/rho/snowflake-2026 v0.1.3` to [`github.com/bds421/rho-snowflake-2026 v1.0.1`](https://github.com/bds421/rho-snowflake-2026). All import paths updated across 14 `.go` files, `go.mod`, `SPEC.md`, and documentation.

### Fixed

- **Deterministic query results** — `NodesByLabel`, `RelationshipsByType`, `OutgoingRelationships`, and `IncomingRelationships` now sort results by snowflake.ID (chronological order). Previously, Go map iteration randomized the output on every call.
- **Cascade-delete outgoing tolerance** — `Graph.DeleteNode` now skips `ErrRelNotFound` in both the outgoing and incoming loops. Previously, a concurrently-deleted outgoing relationship would abort the cascade, leaving a partially severed node.
- **TOCTOU documentation** — `Graph.DeleteNode` documents the per-call locking limitation: without a transactional store API, a concurrent `AddRelationship` can create a dangling edge during cascade. The Badger implementation must wrap the entire cascade in a single `Update()` transaction.

## [3.0.6] - 2026-02-27

### Added

- **`Store` interface** (`pkg/graph/store.go`) — pure persistence contract with `PutNode`/`GetNode`/`DeleteNode`, `PutRelationship`/`GetRelationship`/`DeleteRelationship`, index queries (`NodesByLabel`, `RelationshipsByType`), adjacency queries (`OutgoingRelationships`, `IncomingRelationships`), and counts. Keys are `snowflake.ID`.
- **`MemoryStore`** (`pkg/graph/memorystore.go`) — thread-safe in-memory `Store` implementation. Uses nested hash-set adjacency indexes (`map[snowflake.ID]map[snowflake.ID]struct{}`) for O(1) insert/delete. `PutRelationship` validates start/end nodes exist.
- **`Graph.AddNode(labels, props)`** — creates a node with auto-generated snowflake ID, resolves labels to tokens, and bulk-loads properties via `NewPropertySlice`. Validates input before generating IDs to prevent snowflake waste.
- **`Graph.AddRelationship(typeName, startNode, endNode, props)`** — creates a directed relationship with auto-generated snowflake ID, resolves type to token, validates endpoints are non-nil, and bulk-loads properties.
- **`Graph.DeleteNode(id)`** — cascade-deletes all outgoing and incoming relationships before removing the node. Handles self-loops correctly by skipping `ErrRelNotFound` on the incoming pass.
- **`Graph.DeleteRelationship(id)`** — passthrough to store.
- **Store passthrough queries on Graph**: `GetNode`, `GetRelationship`, `NodesByLabel` (string-based, resolves to token), `RelationshipsByType` (string-based), `NodeCount`, `RelationshipCount`.
- **Shadow property resolution** (`pkg/graph/shadow.go`): `ResolveNodeProperty(n, key)` and `ResolveRelProperty(r, key)` dispatch all 15 `tkg_*` shadow keys. Non-`tkg_` keys delegate to `GetProperty`. Nil-guards on `Temporal()` and `Integrity()` prevent nil-pointer panics on new entities.
- **`NewPropertySlice(map[string]any)`** — O(N log N) bulk loader. Allocates once, validates all values (reserved-prefix + recursive allowlist), sorts once. Replaces the O(N²) per-property `SetProperty` loop for bulk construction.
- **`Node.SetProperties(ps)`** / **`Relationship.SetProperties(ps)`** — assign a pre-built `PropertySlice` directly, bypassing per-property validation (already done by `NewPropertySlice`).
- **SnowflakeID bridge methods**: `nodeID.SnowflakeID()`, `relID.SnowflakeID()`, `entityID.SnowflakeID()` — exported methods on unexported wrapper types for cross-package persistence key extraction.
- **Sentinel errors**: `ErrNodeNotFound`, `ErrRelNotFound`, `ErrNodeExists`, `ErrRelExists`, `ErrNoLabels`, `ErrNilNode`.
- **`Config.Store`** field — pluggable persistence backend. Defaults to `NewMemoryStore()` when nil.

### Changed

- `Graph` struct now holds a `store Store` field alongside registries and generators.
- `New(Config)` initializes a `MemoryStore` when `Config.Store` is nil.
- Implementation phases updated: Phase 2A (Store, MemoryStore, entity management, shadow resolution) complete.

## [3.0.5] - 2026-02-27

### Added

- **`HasLabelTokenRaw(uint16)`** on Node — zero-allocation label check for the graph layer. Accepts raw `uint16` instead of opaque `labelToken`, avoiding the heap allocation from `AllLabelTokens()`.
- **`HasTypeTokenRaw(uint16)`** on Relationship — zero-allocation type check for the graph layer. Mirrors `Node.HasLabelTokenRaw`. Token 0 always returns false.
- **`ErrMaxDepthExceeded` sentinel error.** `PropertySlice.Set()` returns this when a value exceeds 32 levels of nesting, preventing stack overflow from self-referential or deeply nested structures.
- **`ErrEmptyName` sentinel error.** Both `labelRegistry.GetOrCreate` and `relTypeRegistry.GetOrCreate` reject empty strings, preventing ambiguous token resolution.

### Changed

- **Explicit snowflake configuration.** Both snowflake generators now pass `WithEpoch(2026-01-01)`, `WithNodeBits(10)`, `WithStepBits(12)` explicitly instead of relying on defaults.
- **Allowlist property validation.** `validateReflectValue` switched from denylist (reject Ptr/Struct) to allowlist (accept only primitives + safe containers). Arrays, channels, functions, and unsafe pointers are now rejected at any nesting depth.
- **Registry capacity: token 65535 is now assignable.** Fixed off-by-one in `GetOrCreate` that blocked the final token. Capacity check uses `len(toLabel/toName) > 65535` instead of `nextToken >= 65535`.
- **Recursion depth limit.** `validateReflectValue`, `deepCopyValue`, and `reflectCopyValue` now thread a `depth` counter and stop at `maxPropertyDepth` (32). Validation returns an error; copy functions fall back to shallow return.
- `NodeHasLabel` and `RelationshipHasType` use `HasLabelTokenRaw`/`HasTypeTokenRaw` for zero-allocation matching with token-0 defense-in-depth.
- **`deepCopyValue` nil short-circuit.** Nil values return immediately without entering the type switch or reflect path.
- **`Temporal()`/`Integrity()` doc comments** on both Node and Relationship now document the shared-pointer intent (no defensive copy).
- **`ErrUnsupportedValueType` message updated** from "pointer and struct values are not supported" to the generic "unsupported property value type" to reflect the allowlist model.
- `Set()` doc comment updated to describe the allowlist approach and depth limit.

### Fixed

- Empty-string labels and relationship types no longer silently assigned tokens.
- Registry capacity boundary corrected (65535 tokens, not 65534).
- `pkg/graph/doc.go` updated to reflect current state (snowflake generators exist, not "will hold").

## [3.0.3] - 2026-02-27

### Added

- **Snowflake ID generators.** `Graph` now holds two independent `snowflake.Node` generators. `NextNodeID()` and `NextRelID()` produce unique `snowflake.ID` values. `Config.SnowflakeNodeID` is validated (0-1023); out-of-range values return an error from `New()`.
- **Recursive property validation.** `PropertySlice.Set()` traverses slices, maps, and `any`/interface wrappers to reject pointers and structs at any nesting depth (`validatePropertyValue` + `validateReflectValue`).
- **`Instant` type** (`pkg/types`): semantic wrapper for Unix-millisecond timestamps used by all temporal fields.
- **`nodeID` / `relID` opaque types** (`pkg/types`): unexported wrappers around `snowflake.ID`. `InternalID()`, `StartNodeID()`, `EndNodeID()` return these instead of `snowflake.ID` directly.
- **`TemporalMetadata` fields**: `ValidFrom`, `ValidTo`, `TxFrom`, `TxTo`, `CreatedAt`, `UpdatedAt`, `DeletedAt` (all `Instant`), `CreatedBy`, `UpdatedBy` (`string`), `BaseEntityID` (`snowflake.ID`).
- **`NodeIntegrity` / `RelIntegrity` fields**: `Hash`, `PrevHash` (`string`).

### Changed

- `reflectCopyValue` nil-value handling: map keys with nil values are preserved using `reflect.Zero()` instead of silently deleted.
- Registry capacity warning fires exactly once via `sync.Once` (was per-token for 60000-65534).

## [3.0.2] - 2026-02-27

### Added

- **`pkg/graph` package**: Graph layer with label and relationship type registries (Phase 1).
  - `Graph` struct with `Config`, registry ownership, and string resolution methods.
  - `labelRegistry` / `relTypeRegistry`: thread-safe bidirectional string ↔ uint16 token mappings (RWMutex, double-check on write miss). Independent token namespaces.
  - Resolution: `NodeLabels`, `NodePrimaryLabel`, `NodeHasLabel`, `RelationshipType`, `RelationshipHasType`.
  - Registry passthrough: `GetOrCreateLabel`, `GetOrCreateRelType`, `LookupLabel`, `LookupRelType`.
  - Capacity: warning at 60K tokens, error at 65535.
- `labelToken.Value()` and `relTypeToken.Value()` bridge methods for cross-package token access.
- Pointer/struct rejection in `PropertySlice.Set()` with `ErrUnsupportedValueType` sentinel.
- `PropertySlice.Delete(key)` method with `tkg_` prefix guard.
- `Node.DeleteProperty(key)` and `Relationship.DeleteProperty(key)`.

### Changed

- `deepCopyValue` expanded to all common slice/map types plus reflect-based fallback for exotic types.
- `ToMap()` now deep-copies all values.
- Sentinel errors (`ErrReservedPrefix`) properly wrapped for `errors.Is` discrimination.

## [3.0.1] - 2026-02-27

### Added

- `PropertiesMap()` on Node and Relationship.
- `TemporalMetadata` stub struct with `Temporal()`/`SetTemporal()` accessors.
- `NodeIntegrity` and `RelIntegrity` stub structs with `Integrity()`/`SetIntegrity()` accessors.
- Comprehensive `PropertySlice` test suite.

### Changed

- Shadow properties aligned to spec (final 15 `tkg_*` keys).
- Opaque token types (`labelToken`/`relTypeToken`) replace raw `uint16` in public API.
- Token 0 validation: constructors panic, `Has*Token(0)` returns false.
- Extra label deduplication in `NewNode`.

## [3.0.0] - 2026-02-16

### Added

- Initial implementation of `pkg/types`: `Node`, `Relationship`, `PropertySlice`, shadow constants.
- Snowflake ID integration via `github.com/bds421/rho-snowflake-2026`.
- Token interning with `labelToken` and `relTypeToken` (uint16).
- Shadow property protection (`tkg_` prefix rejection).
- Defensive copying on all slice accessors.
